    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>R</m>-algebras. An <em>R-algebra homomorphism</em> (or simply, a <em>morphism of <m>R</m>-algebras</em>) <m>\phi:A\to B</m> is a map which is both a ring homomorphism and an <m>R</m>-module homomorphism.
        </p>
        <p>
            An <m>R</m>-algebra homomorphism from <m>A</m> to itself is called an <em>endormorphism of <m>R</m>-algebras</em>. The set of all endomorphisms of <m>R</m>-algebras is denoted by <m>\End{R}{A}</m>.

    <title>Regular representation</title>
    <statement>
        <p>
            Let <m>F</m> be a field, and let <m>A</m> be an <m>F</m>-algebra. For <m>a\in A</m> we define an <m>F</m>-linear map <m>L_a\colon A\to A</m> by <m>L_a(x)=ax</m> for all <m>x\in A</m>. The following map is called the <em>regular representation</em> of <m>A</m>.
            <me>
                A\to\End{F}{A},\quad\text{given by}\quad a\mapsto L_a.
            </me>
            We leave it to the reader to verify that the regular representation is a homomorphism of <m>F</m>-algebras.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that as <m>A</m> is unital <m>L_a\in\End{F}{A}</m> is nonzero for all nonzero <m>a\in A</m>. Thus, the regular representation is injective.

            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity. Let <m>A</m> be an <m>R</m>-algebra. Show that the quotient <m>A/I</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra for any ideal <m>I</m> of <m>A</m>. Furthermore, show that the natural projection <m>\pi:A\to A/I</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra homomorphism.

            If <m>\phi\colon A\to B</m> is homomorphism of <m>R</m>-algebras, then show that <m>\ker(\phi)</m> is an ideal of <m>A</m> and that the image of <m>\phi</m> is an <m>R</m>-subalgebra of <m>B</m>. Furthermore, show that <m>A/\ker(\phi)\simeq {\rm Im}(\phi)</m> as <m>R</m>-algebras.

Show that <m>\psi</m> factors through <m>\phi</m> (i.e., there exists a homomorphism of <m>R</m>-algebras <m>\theta\colon B\to C</m> such that <m>\psi=\theta\circ\phi</m> if and only if <m>\ker(\phi)\subseteq\ker(\psi)</m>.

            Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity. Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be <m>R</m>-algebras. An <m>R</m>-algebra homomorphism <m>\phi:A\to B</m> is an <em>isomorphism of <m>R</m>-algebras</em> if there exists an <m>R</m>-algebra homomorphism <m>\psi:B\to A</m> such that <m>\psi\circ\phi=\unit_A</m> and <m>\phi\circ\psi=\unit_B</m>.
