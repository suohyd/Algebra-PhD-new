        Let <m>R</m> be a commutative ring with unity <m>1_R</m>. An <term><m>R</m>-algebra</term> or algebra over <m>R</m> is a unital right <m>R</m>-module <m>A</m> together with <m>R</m>-bilinear map <m>A\times A\to A</m> denoted by <m>(x,y)\mapsto xy</m> that is associative, i.e., <m>(xy)z=x(yz)</m> for all <m>x,y,z\in A</m>, and there is a unity <m>1_A\in A</m> such that <m>1_Rx=x1_R=x</m> for all <m>x\in A</m>.

        The bilinearlity of the map <m>A\times A\to A</m> in <xref ref="def-algebra"/> implies the following relation for any <m>x,y\in A</m> and any <m>r\in R</m>.

    We have the following equivalent definition of <m>R</m>-algebra.

  <proposition xml:id="prop-algebra-equiv-def">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Following statements are equivalent.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra

          <li>
            <p>
              <m>A</m> is a ring and a right <m>R</m>-module such that for any <m>x,y\in A</m> and <m>r\in R</m>, we have <m>(xr)y=x(yr)=(xy)r</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </proposition>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra. Then <m>A</m> is a ring with the multiplication given by the <m>R</m>-bilinear map <m>A\times A\to A</m>. Indeed, the associativity of the multiplication follows from the definition. The distributivity of the multiplication over addition follows from the bilinearity of the map. The existence of unity is also given in the definition. The relation <m>(xr)y=x(ry)=(xy)r</m> follows from <xref ref="obs-algebra"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conversely, assume that <m>A</m> is a ring and a right <m>R</m>-module such that for any <m>x,y\in A</m> and <m>r\in R</m>, we have <m>(xr)y=x(yr)=(xy)r</m>. We consider a map <m>m\colon A\times A\to A</m> as the multiplication in ring <m>A</m>. Therefore, <m>m(x+y,z)=m(x,z)+m(y,z)</m> (resp., <m>m(x,y+z)=m(x,y)+m(x,z)</m>) for any <m>x,y,z\in A</m> and also there is a unity in ring <m>A</m>. The <m>R</m>-linearity of the map <m>m</m> follows from the relation <m>(xr)y=x(yr)=(xy)r</m>, i.e., <m>m(xr,y)=m(x,yr)=(x,y)r</m>.

              If <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m> algebra then, there is a ring homomorphism <m>f\colon R\to A</m> such that <m>f(R)</m> is contained in the center of <m>A</m>.

              Suppose that <m>A</m> is a ring and there is a ring homomorphism <m>f\colon R\to A</m> such that <m>f(R)</m> is contained in the center of <m>A</m>. Then, <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra with the right <m>R</m>-module structure given by <m>xr=xf(r)</m> for any <m>x\in A</m> and <m>r\in R</m>.

  </lemma>
  <proof>
    <p>
      If <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra then, we define a map <m>f\colon R\to A</m> by <m>f(r)=1_Ar</m> for any <m>r\in R</m>. It is easy to see that <m>f</m> is a ring homomorphism and <m>f(R)</m> is contained in the center of <m>A</m>. Conversely, suppose that <m>A</m> is a ring and there is a ring homomorphism <m>f\colon R\to A</m> such that <m>f(R)</m> is contained in the center of <m>A</m>. We consider the right <m>R</m>-module structure on <m>A</m> given by <m>xr=xf(r)</m> for any <m>x\in A</m> and <m>r\in R</m>. Then, it is easy to see that the relation in <xref ref="prop-algebra-equiv-def"/>(2) holds. Therefore, by <xref ref="prop-algebra-equiv-def"/>, we conclude that <m>A</m> is an <m>R</m>-algebra.
